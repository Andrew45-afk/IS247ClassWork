## Project Description
Keeping track of courses, students, and grades can be challenging for both students and instructors. 
The Course Management System (CMS) is a Java-based application that allows users to manage course enrollments, track student grades, and generate reports. 
This project will incorporate object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and a basic GUI.
