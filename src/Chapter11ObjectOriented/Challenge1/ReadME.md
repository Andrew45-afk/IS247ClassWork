# Book Management Challenge

## Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating a simple program to manage books in a library. Follow the steps below:

### Requirements
1. **Create a class named `Book`**
2. **Define two properties in the `Book` class:**
   - `title` (String): Represents the title of the book.
   - `author` (String): Represents the author of the book.
3. **Create a method named `displayDetails` in the `Book` class.**
   - This method should print the book's title and author in the following format:
     ```
     Title: [title], Author: [author]
     ```
4. **In the `main` method:**
   - Create an object of the `Book` class.
   - Set the `title` and `author` properties for the object.
   - Call the `displayDetails` method to display the book's details.


## Instructions
1. Create a new Java file (e.g., `Main.java`).
2. Implement the `Book` class and the `main` method as described above.
3. Run the program to verify that the output matches the expected result.

## Expected Output
If the title is set to `"The Great Gatsby"` and the author is set to `"F. Scott Fitzgerald"`, the output should be:
```
Title: The Great Gatsby, Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
```
